This program facilitates the process of ordering products by allowing users to compare prices at various stores and select the most advantageous offers based on parameters such as price and quantity. It also speeds up the ordering process by quickly providing information on prices at multiple stores simultaneously and automatically selecting the optimal option.

Through price parsing and saving to a database, the user can view current prices for products at each store and choose the most suitable option for ordering products online.

The program interface is a web page where the user can edit the list of products, change the quantity of products, add new ones, or delete existing ones. After selecting the most suitable option for ordering products, the user can simply click the "Order" button, and the program will automatically send the order to the selected store.

Overall, this program is a useful tool for those who regularly order products online and want to save time and money while doing so.
